# Crosschain Data and Token Transfer between Avalanche and Ethereum

## Description

This project aims to demonstrate the interoperability between the Avalanche and Ethereum blockchains through Chainlink's CCIP protocol. The goal is to transfer data and tokens seamlessly between the two networks, showcasing the potential of crosschain solutions.

## Features

- **Data Transfer:** Use crosschain technology to securely transmit data between Avalanche and Ethereum.
- **Token Transfer:** Transfer tokens between Avalanche and Ethereum networks, allowing for crosschain token swaps. Only tokens that are considered in Chainlink's pools in both networks are eligible for transfer.


## Technologies Used

- CCIP: Cross-chain interoperability protocol powered by Chainlink.
- Hardhat: framework for developing and testing smart contracts in EVM.
